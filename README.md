# Zero to Mastery Machine Learning

Welcome! This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, images and other materials related to the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning Course on Udemy.

As the course is still being developed, it's still a work in progress.

If you'd like to see anything in particular, please send me an email: [daniel@mrdbourke.com](mailto:daniel@mrdbourke.com) or leave an issue.

## How this course is structured

There are three major styles of materials in this course. Each major section contains at least one of the following:

1. Blog post - an overview of the concepts and code covered in the section.
2. Video lectures - walk-throughs of different concepts and code (on Udemy, YouTube & Loom videos where applicable).
3. Project - putting together what you've learned in a hands-on project.

There will be overlaps between each one of the above since each tries to convey a concept from a different angle.

## What this course focuses on

1. Create a process for working through problems
2. Map process on best tools
3. Targeted practice = build a portfolio to show off your work

TODO - Tidbit videos/posts
These tidbits can be like little segments to break up the course through content heavy sections.
- Day in the life type videos
- Skills they don't teach
- How to ask questions of a problem
- How to research like a boss
- How to cut through the weeds and find what matters (reducing the search space), focusing on one thing... less but better

TODO - How to go through this course
- Make a Trello/Notion board/Project (see the tab above) of how to go through this course
- Want to make an outline of steps a person can follow and the way they can go through the course
