# Zero to Mastery Machine Learning

Blog posts, scripts, projects and code related to the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning course on Udemy.

## How this course is structured

There are three major styles of materials in this course. Each major seciton contains at least one of the following:

1. Blog post - an overview of the concepts and code covered in the section.
2. Video lectures - walk-throughs of different concepts and code (on Udemy, YouTube & Loom videos where applicable).
3. Project - putting together what you've learned in a hands-on project.

There will be overlaps between each one of the above since each tries to convey a concept from a different angle.

## What this course focuses on

1. Create a process for working through problems
2. Map process on best tools
3. Targeted practice = build a portfolio to show off your work

TODO - Tidbit videos/posts
These tidbits can be like little segments to break up the course through content heavy sections.
- Day in the life type videos
- Skills they don't teach
- How to ask questions of a problem
- How to research like a boss
- How to cut through the weeds and find what matters (reducing the search space), focusing on one thing... less but better

TODO - How to go through this course
- Make a Trello/Notion board/Project (see the tab above) of how to go through this course
- Want to make an outline of steps a person can follow and the way they can go through the course

## Table of Contents
TODO - make this sound better, as in "this is structured like a week in the life of a new data science/machine learning hire... we're going to go through what you'd do"
